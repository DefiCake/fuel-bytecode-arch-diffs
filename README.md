# Docker

To see the differences, run:

- With ts code:
`docker compose up ts_aarch ts_x86`

This will just compute the sha256 of the generated `forc build --release` bytecode.

Expected results are:

- SHA256 of the generated bytecode in the X86 container: `0x8f9b08b4c6afa426ffd705d796455ac0458151b7ed8d11cc369d3014f096b904`
- ^ in the aarch container: `0xea03f5290c66aae0bb9318a41e0d4f8ada16125f8c286fe1a71d10ae999ff839`

- With rust code:
`docker compose up rs_aarch rs_x86`

This will give the contract IDs as well, but it is significantly slower to run due to compilation, the first should be enough.

If you want to run all, then `docker compose up`

# Locally

Build sway:
`forc build --release`

Run code:
`cargo run`
or
`yarn && ts-node index.ts`
